## Project Evaluations

### CowPi Projects

Evaluation criteria and outcomes of certain projects:

- **Stream-Pi (Discontinued)**: An open-source, cross-platform, programmable, modular macropad software.
  - **Criteria of Failure**:
    - **M**: No documentation.
    - **M**: Inactive project (No developments for 1 year).
    - **M**: Inactive Discord community (No messages for 1 month).
    - **B&M**: Project instability and unreliability:
      - Worked in a limited capacity and failed to function after closing and reopening.
      - The unreliability led to the project becoming a time sink, potentially hindering progress with automation technologies.
  - **Remarks**:
    - Initial excitement was high with successful communication between the touchscreen and Raspberry Pi, showcasing potential for complex interactions.
    - Secure shell sessions from a laptop to the Raspberry Pi were initially promising.
    - Anticipation for advancing to server-client interactions for enhanced connectivity.
    - Disappointment in not achieving the programming of macros for workflow automation and interfacing programmable control stations.

This repository is a living document and will be updated with new projects, resources, and evaluations over time. Stay tuned for more Raspberry Pi adventures!
