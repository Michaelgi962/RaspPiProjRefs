## Project Evaluations

### CowPi Projects

Evaluation criteria and outcomes of certain projects:

- **Stream-Pi (Discontinued)**: An open-source, cross-platform, programmable, modular macropad software.
  - **Criteria of Failure**:
    - **M**: No documentation.
    - **M**: Inactive project (No developments for 1 year).
    - **M**: Inactive Discord community (No messages for 1 month).
    - **B&M**: Project instability and unreliability:
      - Worked in a limited capacity and failed to function after closing and reopening.
      - The unreliability led to the project becoming a time sink, potentially hindering progress with automation technologies.
  - **Remarks on Project Experience**:
    - **Initial Success**: The project began with high excitement, notably with the successful communication between the touchscreen and the Raspberry Pi. This early achievement demonstrated the potential for sophisticated programmable interactions, leveraging the client running on the Raspberry Pi for dynamic control.

    - **Secure Shell Sessions**: Establishing secure shell sessions from a laptop to the Raspberry Pi showed promise, hinting at the feasibility of remote management and operation, which was initially promising for the project's scalability and flexibility.

    - **Anticipated Developments**: There was strong anticipation for evolving the project to include server-client interactions. This step was expected to significantly enhance connectivity, allowing for more complex and responsive interactions between devices.

    - **Disappointment in Macro Programming**: A notable disappointment came from not achieving the programming of macros for workflow automation and interfacing programmable control stations. This goal was central to pushing the boundaries of what could be accomplished with the Raspberry Pi in terms of automation and control, and its non-fulfillment left a gap in the project's aspirations.
